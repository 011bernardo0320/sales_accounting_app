MediaQuery.of(context).padding.top = get the app status bar size.

Bookmarks:
ctrl + alt + k = toogle bookmark.
ctrl + alt + j = previous.
ctrl + alt + l = next.
ctrl + alt + h = list all bookmarks.
ctrl + alt + 5 = list from all files.
ctrl + alt + c = clear all bookmarks.

Singleton:
-A singleton allows you to access the same instace with the same state anywhere.
-By making the constructor private you prevent it from being initialized and stop being a singleton.
-By making instance as final you prevent it from being changed.

Interface:
-Always set the variable as the interface and then instantiate some of this interface's implementation:
--final LocalStorageInterface storage = LocalStorage();

Some packages for storing local data:
-shared preferences
-hive
-sqlite
-many more...
Before storing, the data is only on the app state, it means in the RAM memory. => Search if it is correct.
